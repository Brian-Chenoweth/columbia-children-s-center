          Our Young Toddler Program serves children from {ageRange}. Our maximum care giver to child ratio is 1:6. The maximum group size in this program is 12 children. We provide a nurturing environment that is structured enough to allow our students to learn and grow in a safe and confident way. Here at CCC your child can explore and learn through age appropriate activities and toys. Children are encouraged to use their words to express their wants and needs. In our Young Toddler classroom, we focus on activities developed on creating learning and social experiences through play.
