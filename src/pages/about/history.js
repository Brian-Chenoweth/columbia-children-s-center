        <h2 className={'history'}>1990</h2>
        <p>Your People Professionals, an employee leasing company, opened in the old Columbia Records building across the parking lot from our location. At that time, Bonnie Royster &amp; Lisa Chenoweth were owners of Your People Professionals. Lisa's children, as well as children of employees of YPP were in a preschool program in Santa Maria. The preschool was closed down abruptly due to financial problems.</p>

        <h2 className={'history'}>1991</h2>
        <p>Because of Bonnie's career in human resources, she understood the importance of employee's having quality childcare for them to be successful in their lives and jobs. She and Lisa decided to explore the possibility of opening a childcare facility. Lisa worked closely with owners and directors of local programs to design the building. The owner of the property at the time, Rob Rossi, built CCC to our specifications. Lisa &amp; Bonnie then searched for a qualified director and began to develop the program and purchase equipment.</p>

        <h2 className={'history'}>1992</h2>
        <p>Our state of the art building was completed and our program was opened under the Direction of Corinne Pollard. We offered care to children 6 weeks to 6 years in the following programs: Infant, Toddler, Preschool and Kindergarten Readiness.</p>

        <h2 className={'history'}>2014</h2>
        <p>Columbia Children's Center's property was purchased by the owners of the Shepard Eye Center. At this time, there were concerns if our parking lot could handle our customers as well as the customers of the Shepard Eye Center. We began looking for a place to relocate.</p>

        <h2 className={'history'}>2015</h2>
        <p>The word spread that we were having a difficult time finding a place to relocate. Current and past families of Columbia Children's Center rallied to save us. Due to these family's as well as the efforts of a local business man Dave Cross, the city of Santa Maria was able to come up with a modified parking plan. This modified plan gave us the ability to remain onsite along with the Shepard Eye Center.</p>

        <h2 className={'history'}>2017</h2>
